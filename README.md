- However,Comedy genre has the best rating in comparison to all the other genres.

- The average length of a movie is 95 minutes.


## Recommendations.

- I would recommend they produce movies of an average of 95 minutes.
- Microsoft box should apply language dubbing on their movies so that they can share their movies worldwide.
