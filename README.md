## Conclusions.

- Drama genre is the most watched genre.
- However,Comedy genre has the best rating in comparison to all the other genres.
- The best perfoming genres in terms of ratings are: Comedy,Action/Adventure/Sci- Fi,Drama/War,Drama/Thriller,Biography/Drama/Sport.
- The better the rating the more the gross on the movie.
- The length of a movie does not affect the movie's rating.
- The average length of a movie is 95 minutes.


## Recommendations.
- Microsoft Box should put their main focus on producing: Comedy,Action/Adventure/Sci- Fi,Drama/War,Drama/Thriller,Biography/Drama/Sport.
- I would recommend they produce movies of an average of 95 minutes.
- Microsoft box should apply language dubbing on their movies so that they can share their movies worldwide.
